# ✈️ Flight Fare Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict flight prices based on features like airline, source, destination, duration, stops, and more. It helps users estimate ticket prices and understand what factors influence flight fares.

# 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 📌 What I Did

1. Cleaned and preprocessed the flight dataset  
2. Extracted useful features from date, time, and duration  
3. Handled categorical variables using encoding  
4. Built regression models to predict fare (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Evaluated models using R² score and error metrics  
6. Shared insights on fare-influencing factors

# 📈 Results

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **R² Score**: ~0.82  
- Found that total stops, duration, and airline have major impact on fare predictions.
